                    Technology surrounds us right now, that everyone can't live without one. These are our medium of communication and information gathering to keep us updated. Websites, apps, or games are what makes these technologies more entertaining and fun to use. I once dreamed about being able to create my own app from my own idea and my own desires, but that dream is starting to become a reality because of the Information and Technology on Mobile App and Web Development or the ITMAWE strand. (It should be ITMAWD but whatever)

                        In the ITMAWE strand, you first start with the basics to help you progress better to transition into the more advance part of programming. You may feel intimidated first but once you get the feel of it, the more you'll understand things. Application development is never an easy task to do depending on the app you want to develop but keep in mind that challenges are things that make this strand stand above the rest.

                        I know some of you are wondering and some will say "I wan't to be a programmer, but I'm not good at math" and this might be your impressions into programming but I'll tell you right now that you don't have to be good at math to be able to program, but it helps if you know how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide. (Don't worry though, the computer will compute it for you if you can't solve large numbers) : D

                    If you want to learn programming, you can start now! There's a lot of free tutorials on YouTube and around the internet that will help guide you into the basics of programming. Don't be afraid to Google stuff and try to search anything because even experienced programmers do this too. Schools just restrict you to do this kind of stuff to help you build your memory. (I don't have a good memory so I tend to search things that I already knew but forgotten).
            </p>
            <p class="blog-content"> 
                    Don't also stress out the programming language you'll be using, just start with any programming language that you seem to find useful in your case (In our case you should learn Java for mobile development) since every language has huge similarities and small differences on a surface level. 
            </p>
            <p class="blog-content"> 
                    I hope you gain courage to take the path of an ITMAWE student because there's a lot of fun things to happen and a lot of fun things to do. I'm sure that once you finish your first program or app you will be satisfied or impressed to yourself because you are able to do things like this. If everyone can do it, you can do it too.
